# What-ever-the-Weather

A simple browser based weather dashboard, using two APIs to retrieve a 5 Day Weather Forecast for a user defined city. This project runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. LocalStorage is used to store persistent data in the form of city data, which in turn is used to populate a user history, to allow weather data for previously searched cities to be quickly accessed via buttons.

#The application:

Presents a weather dashboard with a search form input for city name.
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future (5 day forecast) conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

User input is validated, prompting for a valid city name if failed.

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

The city name
The date
An icon representation of weather conditions
The temperature
The humidity
The wind speed

When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

The date
An icon representation of weather conditions
The temperature
The humidity
